# Why personas?

> Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way.

* Rikke Dam and Teo Siang, Interaction Design Foundation

Personas are design and communication tools that:

* consider the **usersâ€™ perspective and experience,** not ours
* help us **understand our audience**
* encourage us to **question our assumptions**
* ensure we focus on **what matters to people** and **has the most** **impact**
* provide a **useful foundation** and **starting point** for any project

Personas help us:

* describe and empathize with our **target audience**
* get on the same page about **who** we are designing for
* guide decisions related to **services**, **products**, **content**, **design**, and more

# Creating personas

## Choosing a type of persona

**Proto personas** are based on existing knowledge and assumptions about your audience. They are quick, easy, and imperfect. Their main goal is to get a team on the same page about your users. You can sketch an assumption persona in a 30 minute meeting, or run a workshop to create a set of personas in a couple of hours.

**Research-based personas** are based on user research data gathered from such methods as user interviews, surveys, web analytics, and focus groups. They take more time but are more authentic and often more useful than assumption-based personas. Research-based personas can be **qualitative** or **statistical**, and may take a few weeks or months to create. We usually recommend qualitative personas, which are quicker to create that statistical personas and more reflective of real users than proto personas.

## Choosing your audience segments

Each persona should represent a segment of your audience. You can determine a segment by recognizing which clusters of your audience have similar goals and behaviors when it comes to the service or product you are designing. For example, if you are building a learning management system for a university you might have an "instructor" and "student" persona. If you are designing a study lounge you might have a "collaborative studier" and a "quiet studier" persona.

Avoid creating personas based on demographics, such as age or location. Focus instead on the audience's purpose: what are they trying to do? Why would they use your product?

Avoid having too many personas to remember. We recommend no more than 5 personas per product or service. You also might consider primary vs. secondary personas. For example, an academic library could have:

**Primary personas:** instructor, student, researcher

**Secondary personas:** employee, donor

## Building your personas

If you work at the UA Libraries, try adapting one of our [existing qualitative personas](https://arizona.app.box.com/file/683899687803), which were based on user research in 2018.

Everyone else, start with our [persona template](https://arizona.app.box.com/file/683897205829). The components of the template include:

1. A **name** and key **audience segment**. By giving the persona a name, it will be easier to refer to it in your project discussions. Some people like to use alliteration to make it more memorable (e.g. "Rui the Researcher").
2. **Goals**. These describe the person's overarching professional, personal, or academic goals. They don't have to be related directly to the product or service, though should have some relevance to what you are designing. For example, a student's goal might be "Graduate within four years."
3. **Behaviors**. These describe actual or potential behaviors or actions the person would have with the particular product or service. They are much more specific than goals. For example, a potential student's behavior related to a financial aid website might be, "Apply for a scholarship."

With these components identified, you can fill in the details and bring the person to life:

1. A **representative quote**. Ideally, this can be a real quote that represents the feelings or context of this audience segment.
2. A **photo**. This is optional and has benefits and drawbacks. A photo is beneficial because it can make the person more relatable and help build empathy, but may cause assumptions or bias. Avoid using generic stock images.
3. **Descriptors**. These adjectives can help bring the person to life and build empathy. Descriptors can include common characteristics such as "motivated," "curious," or "busy."
4. **Constraints.** These describe technical, knowledge, or other constraints that may prevent the person from achieving their goals or behaviors. For example, a new instructor's constraints might be, "Has never taught online before" or, "Experiences imposter syndrome." They tend to reflect broad personal or professional constraints, though if useful they can reflect specific known pain points associated with the product or service, such as "Uses an iPad to access the interface" or "Not familiar with grant terminology."
